			</header>
			<p>Below are images from Meg's House current website, of things that are mostly not working, but there are some elements in there that are working. Things that are not working for Meg's House is the color selection, which is a maroon purple shade that doesn't give the audience the feeling of comfort that you would want to give someone struggling with domestic violence. Also, when you initally go to the website, you are greeted with having to download Adobe Flash player becuase they have one of their YouTube videos on the homepage of their site which is not a good way to increase traffic on the website. Another issue on Meg's website is the fact that they seem to only use HTML, there is not much CSS involved at all so the site feels very static. Sinces Meg's House is intended to help women and children more forward in their lives, the website should have the ability to make women feel like they are about to overcome something. 
			</p>
			<p>Now, after looking at some of the bad design choices of Meg's House, lets look at some of the positives. Meg's House is sure to let their audience know that they are a safe zone, which is a very important aspect of this non-profit. On the website, there is also a Donate Now button which is very beneficial and can be seen from any page you are on. They also keep what seems to be a very updated list of things that they need for the women and children they are helping. Meg's House is also good about including their contact information on multiple pages in case someone needs immediate help. These are definitely things that I intend to keep on the updated website, because this is one of the most important parts of the site.

			<p class="info">This section of research is showing statistics and possible solutions.</p>
		</header>

		<p>After doing some research on domestic violence alot of things have come to mind for solutions. One solution I have decided on is a color change potentially to a blue green color pallette, which is a highly successful logo pallette to work with. Also, research shows that certain shades of blues and greens can relieve anxiety, and using these colors on the website can help women find comfort and peace while they are trying to take the next step in getting out of a difficult and draining situation. Another thing I have found while doing reseach is that 1 in 4 women will deal with domestic violence at some point in their lives and keeping this information on the website will make sure that the audience knows they aren't in this alone. According to research, young women, ages 16 to 24, experience the highest rate of domestic violence, so this means the redesign of Meg's House needs to also be able to reach a younger crowd. These groups of women need to be able to come to this site and feel included and like it was made for them. Gathering this information has helped determine really important aspects of this redesign. </p>
