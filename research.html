				<h1>Client Research</h1>
				<p class="info">This section of research helps to understand the goals and website decisions of Meg's
					House.</p>
			</header>
			<p>Below are images from Meg's House current website, of things that are mostly not working, but there are
				some elements in there that are working. Things that are not working for Meg's House is the color
				selection, which is a maroon purple shade that doesn't give the audience the feeling of comfort that you
				would want to give someone struggling with domestic violence. Also, when you initally go to the website,
				you are greeted with having to download Adobe Flash player becuase they have one of their YouTube videos
				on the homepage of their site which is not a good way to increase traffic on the website. Another issue
				on Meg's website is the fact that they seem to only use HTML, there is not much CSS involved at all so
				the site feels very static. Sinces Meg's House is intended to help women and children more forward in
				their lives, the website should have the ability to make women feel like they are about to overcome
				something.
			</p>
			<p>Now, after looking at some of the bad design choices of Meg's House, lets look at some of the positives.
				Meg's House is sure to let their audience know that they are a safe zone, which is a very important
				aspect of this non-profit. On the website, there is also a Donate Now button which is very beneficial
				and can be seen from any page you are on. They also keep what seems to be a very updated list of things
				that they need for the women and children they are helping. Meg's House is also good about including
				their contact information on multiple pages in case someone needs immediate help. These are definitely
				things that I intend to keep on the updated website, because this is one of the most important parts of
				the site.

				<h1>Secondary Research</h1>
				<p class="info">This section of research is showing statistics and possible solutions.</p>
			</header>
			<h2>Step 1: Explore the most recent news in your clients field</h2>
			<div class="box alt">
				<div class="row 50% uniform">
					<div class="12u$"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/CovidandViolence.png" alt="" class="image-shadow"/></span>
					</div>
				</div>
				<br>
				<br>
				<p>One of the leading issues in domestic violence right now is living in a pandemic. It makes it very
					difficult for victims to get away from their abusers.</p>
				<p>Growing evidence shows the pandemic has made intimate partner violence more common—and often more
					severe. “COVID doesn’t make an abuser,” says Jacky Mulveen, project manager of Women’s Empowerment
					and Recovery Educators, an advocacy and support group in Birmingham, England. “But COVID exacerbates
					it. It gives them more tools, more chances to control you. The abuser says, ‘You can’t go out;
					you’re not going anywhere,’ and the government also is saying, ‘You have to stay in.” </p>

				<h2>Step 2: Try to find recent innovations in your client's field</h2>
				<div class="box alt">
					<div class="row 50% uniform">
						<div class="12u$"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/Innovations.png" alt="" class="image-shadow" /></span>
						</div>
					</div>
					<br>
					<br>
					<p>What is needed is a preventative approach that allows for the dismantling of intersecting systems
						of oppression that leave women vulnerable. First, we must provide education on healthy
						relationships at an early age. Second, leaving an abusive partner, even during a pandemic, needs
						to be a real option, which means increasing affordable housing, shelter space, access to
						financial support and culturally relevant healthcare. Finally, prevention strategies should be
						focused both on potential victims and on potential abusers, reflecting a societal shift away
						from victim blaming.
					</p>
					<p>
						According to Crosby, “often what we do is we place the burden on the people who are being abused
						to get out.” She says that any policy changes and public messaging need instead to let victims
						know “it’s not your fault that people are processing their anger in this way. It’s not your
						fault that people aren’t able to face their own trauma.”</p>

					<h2>Step 3: Look at ofther solutions. Which worked? which didn't?</h2>
					<div class="box alt">
						<div class="row 50% uniform">
							<div class="12u$"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/NotWorking.png" alt="" class="image-shadow"/></span>
							</div>
						</div>
						<br>
						<br>
						<p>This site is of a local domestic violence website that is intended to help women regain
							saftey. However, this site is very triggering and is not working for making women feel safe.
							This website will likley bring traumatic memories up when they view it. It does have an
							effective nav bar which is something I will address in the redesign.</p>
						<br>
						<div class="box alt">
							<div class="row 50% uniform">
								<div class="12u$"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/WorkingSite.png"
											alt="" class="image-shadow"/></span>
								</div>
							</div>
							<br>
							<br>
							<p>This site is an example of a website that is working because it uses calming colors and
								images. It also takes you to a get help page as the home page. This is effective if the
								victim needs immidiate help and only has a few seconds to view the page.</p>

							<h2>Step 4: Any data that is relevant</h2>

							<p>Research shows that certain shades of blues and
								greens can relieve anxiety, and using these colors on the website can help women find
								comfort
								and peace
								while they are trying to take the next step in getting out of a difficult and draining
								situation.
								Another thing I have found while doing reseach is that 1 in 4 women will deal with
								domestic
								violence at
								some point in their lives and keeping this information on the website will make sure
								that the
								audience
								knows they aren't in this alone. According to research, young women, ages 16 to 24,
								experience
								the
								highest rate of domestic violence, so this means the redesign of Meg's House needs to
								also be
								able to
								reach a younger crowd. These groups of women need to be able to come to this site and
								feel
								included and
								like it was made for them. Gathering this information has helped determine really
								important
								aspects of
								this redesign.</p>

								<h1>Interviews</h1>
								<p class="info">This section is devoted to the two interviews that were from the client and a user.</p>
							</header>
							<h2>Client Interview</h2>
							<p>
								I was able to interview Whitney Marcengil, who is the director of finance at Meg's House and she was able to give me a look into Meg's House, their website, and how their comapny runs as a whole. While talking with Whitney, she mentioned that she basically only works with the financial side and not much of the women and children seeking help. However, she does handle to donation money and mentioned that people more often donated money instead of things off the wishlist on the website. Even though she doesn't work directly with the public, she was able to inform me that people do not usually use their website and it does not seem to be updated frequently. She did mention that it would be beneficial to update the website more often to help women who are mostly seeking shelter, helping hands, and a safe place. Also, Whitney discussed with me that women are referred to Meg's House through case managers and normally stay in their shelter, however that is closed due to Covid. We did discuss that overall Meg's House is in need of more donations and funding and hopefully through the redesign, the website will be more active helping with this issue.
							</p>
							<h2>User Interview</h2>
							<p>
								For my user interview, I was able to interview Kristen Roberson who talked with me about how she would handle a friend struggling with domestic violence. I spoke with her about what steps she would most likley go through if she encountered this situation. First, she began stating that she woul want to reach out for help. Probaly not knowing where to look, she would go to Google to begin her search in hopes that she would get some answers. Assuming taht she came across the Meg's House webstie, she would be navigating to a hotline phone numner or the contact information of an employee whome she could trust and talk through the situation with. Knowing this information, I believe it is impotant to have the contact infomration or a call to action button that is easy to find for someone in a situation like this. 
<br>
<br>
								We also went though the senario of what she would be looking for if she wanted to help the public struggling with domestic violence, including women and children. I asked here where on a webpage she checks first for information and she mentioned the initial main text and the navigation bar so it will be important for this section to have links staright to the donate page, wishlist, and resourse page. After talking thorugh these things she mostly mentioned that it would be really beneficial to be able to find things quickly in the event of an emergency or trying to get help to the public.
