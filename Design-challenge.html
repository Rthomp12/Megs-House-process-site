				<p class="info">How to overcome Meg's House design issues</p>
			</header>
			<div>
				<h2>What is the problem you are trying to solve?</h2>

				<p>The problem I am trying to solve is helping women and children struggling with domestic violence.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h2>Take a stab at framing it as a design question.</h2>

				<p>How can Meg's House redesign ensure women and children feel safe and empowered during their
					struggles?</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h2>Now state the ultimate impact you are trying to have.</h2>

				<p>The ultimate impact I am trying to have on these women is to make sure they feel included and know
					that they can trust this company and its values.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h2>What are some possible solutions to your problem? Think broadly. It's fine to start a project with a
					hunch or two, but make sure you allow for surprising outcomes.</h2>

				<p>Some possible solutions that can be done to help Meg's House is developing a new logo, including a color change. The current color choice has a hint of red which is one of the most anxiety inducing colors; this alone is a reason people may not want to visit the site. Another solution is looking into different typeface, maybe considering san-serif becuase it is a more modern type and this is a modern/everyday issue.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h2>Finally, write down some of the context and constraints that you're facing. They could be geographic,
					technological, time-based, or have to do with the population you are trying to reach.</h2>

				<p>One constraint that may be an issue, is this location being outside of Anderson, so I may not be able to visit the acutal location. Also, finding a user that struggles with this issue to get some good insight from may be an issue, as not everyone is comfortable discussing their expereinces.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h2>Does your original question need a tweak? Try it again.</h2>

				<p>How can Meg's House clearly show that they are a trusted non-proft organization and ensure they can make these women feel empowered while knowing they can trust the company and their values?</p>
