			<h2>Define Your Audience</h2>
			<section>
				<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/FullChart.jpg" alt="" /></span>First, I began looking at
					the audience directly involved and then I slowly began to narrow down my
					audience so that I understood everyone who could be involved. This is my full chart of me
					trying to understand my audience and their goals of using the website of Meg's House. Through this,
					I have been able to pin point the audience involved and what their goals are while figuring out what
					category the user may fall under. Here you can view the full list of those directly involved,
					peripherally involved, skeptics, and fans. These full categories are divided into small groups that
					help me decide how they are using the website and if they are using it effectively. The main purpose
					of this is to enusre that we have what the user needs access to on the website.</p>
				<br>
				<br>
			

				<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/Involved.jpg" alt="" /></span>This view point of the
					audience chart goes specifically into those who are directly involved or peripherally involved. This
					specifically shows who will be most active on the site and who will be less active on it. It shows
					divided categories of who needs help, which are the domestic violence victims and children involved.
					This also shows those who are often giving help, which are the friends and families of victims,
					donators, and domestic violence hotlines. The people involved who need help and who give help are
					both potentially active users on the website searching for help from a trust worthy non-profit
					organization.</p>
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>

				<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/Skeptics_fans.jpg" alt="" /></span>
				The skeptics and fans are also an important part of the audience involved. Although they will not be involved on the website as much as those directly involved, it is still important to consider them looking into things on the website. Since these skeptics may be on the website, it may be imporatnt to have a place for them to understand the laws of domestic violence and the signs of it, so that they can tell if they are reading the situation right. For the fans, they may be interested in knowing the statistics of domestic violence or be looking for fellow supporters.</p>

				<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/and_or.jpg" alt="" /></span>Finally, there is a section to consider that involves the and/or category. This category focuses on the overlapping audience. This consists of the news, police officers, and potentially social media. Social media and the news can fall under giving help or the skeptics because the people on it will either be supporting the victims or questioning them. So this group of people may be on the website hoping to gain knowledge about domestic violence or potentially to go against the site. So it is important to think about how these users will use the websit while designing it. This also goes for the police officers who are either supporting the victim or supporting the abusers accusations. Overall, the website design needs to be inclusive of all parties.</p>
